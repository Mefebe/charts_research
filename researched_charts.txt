	cons:
		- hard to use
		- not looking good

apexcharts:
	link: https://apexcharts.com/
	license: MIT

	pros:
		- free
		- js based
		- MIT license
		- offer many option (ready charts)
		- there is x/y chart with considerably
        handy zooming capabilities. demo:
		- there is candle stick chart link:
		https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/candlestick-charts/basic/
	https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/scatter-charts/basic/

	cons:
		- it may hard to modify(for not it seems hard to me)
		- do not have ready chart that meets out requirements(
		but it is sufficiently customizable)
		- it is slow on large data sets. 

	ekstra notes:
		- by learning details of library I think it meets our requirements.
		- to assign different color to outliers probably
	          'fill' can be used.
